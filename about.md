## Introduction

[Mining Rig Assembly](http://rigassembly.web.engr.illinois.edu/) is a Web-based Application that allows the users to browse different parts of a mining rig, store rig setups, and estimate the performance of their setups on one integrated site. Users can set their expected payback periods for the setups, and our application will calculate the potential proﬁts of them based on real-time price information, and notify the user when their expected payback periods can be achieved. Whats more, this website can visualize the performance comparison between different setups and components for speciﬁc users.

## Description
1. There are several websites that help users assemble mining rigs for bit-coin, but few of them focus on Ether. Our website targets the Ether investors.
2. Users can know when their expected payback period will be met. Our website will calculate the payback period of different setups dynamically, and send an email to the users once the payback period meet the expectation.
3. Users can obtain the performance comparisons between their setups and components. We not only visualize the performance of the setups and the components, but also the comparison between setups and components. This is a practical function for users as they can view and choose their setup more intuitively.
