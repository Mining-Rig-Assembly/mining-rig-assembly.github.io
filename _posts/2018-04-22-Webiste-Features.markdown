# Website Features


## Functionality
1. Display list of components in the database(CPU, GPU, motherboard, power supply, RAM).
2. Store user setup speciﬁed in user input.
3. Display speciﬁed component information.
4. Calculate total price and payback period.
5. Compare component parts between different setups with visualization.

## Advanced Functions

1. Calculate payback period of the mining rig investment 
	- This function is the core of this application. It allows the users to plan their investments without having to monitor every little aspect of the market at all time. It is especially useful, and convenient to have in the current situation because of how rapidly the prices are changing. This function is advanced because it requires additional data from GPU such as hash rate and power consumption. Also, it update ETH price and component price in the database automatically and send email notiﬁcation to user if they subscribe the set they created.
2. Comparisons between different parts/setups with visualization 
	- This can help user easier to understand the trade-off of different setups and choose the best setup based on the comparison. This function is advanced because it needs to summarize data into useful information such as total price of the setup and the payback period for each user setups for comparison.
